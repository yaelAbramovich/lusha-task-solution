# Demoblaze Testing Project

## 📌 Description

The project navigates to the Demoblaze site and attempts to sign up a user. If the user is already registered, an appropriate message will be displayed. Otherwise, the user will be signed up automatically. After signing up, the user logs in, adds items to the cart, verifies that all expected items are displayed, checks the total count, completes a purchase, and confirms the purchase was successful.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Type Script
- Playwright
- Playwright HTML report

## 🐛 Issues & Contributions

1. I had to wait 1 second after adding an item to the cart due to the site's slowness. I typically avoid using implicit wait. If I had more time, I would have found the proper solution for this issue.
2. For testing new user sign up: run without .env file or change .env file values.
3. For testing signed up user: You can use username: yael11, password: 12345
